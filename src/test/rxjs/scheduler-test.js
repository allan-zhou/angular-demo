/* 
 * What is a Scheduler? 
 * A scheduler controls when a subscription starts and when notifications are delivered. 
 * 
 * It consists of three components:
 * A Scheduler is a data structure. It knows how to store and queue tasks based on priority or other criteria.
 * A Scheduler is an execution context. It denotes where and when the task is executed (e.g. immediately, or in another callback mechanism such as setTimeout or process.nextTick, or the animation frame).
 * A Scheduler has a (virtual) clock. It provides a notion of "time" by a getter method now() on the scheduler. Tasks being scheduled on a particular scheduler will adhere only to the time denoted by that clock.
 * 
 * A Scheduler lets you define in what execution context will an Observable deliver notifications to its Observer.
